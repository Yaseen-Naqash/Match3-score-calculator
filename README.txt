hi im Yaseen
a gamer who loves coding or idk a coder who loves games
recently i was playing a gamble game named match 3 poker
a combination of poker and match 3 that is playable in some online casinos and a app (which i used to play with the app) named poker offline (which is online idk why they call it offline xD)
if you want to make some money from gambling (that i dont recomend) or you want to have some fun (thats what i recomend), go learn it and then come back and see my thing.
if not, so go away and save your time.

THIS IS A SCORE CALCULATOR that can calculate each move you can play and tell you which move has the highest score.
its Ez to see some normal moves in this game but like chess, when the board is crowed some of brilliant moves cant be found with normal eyes.
this calculator will help you to see game changing moves and feel power of programming (at least as a junior i felt it).

NOTICE: this is some kind of CHEAT. so dont use it if you believe in humanity or some kind of god or half god or a cow from india... (i dont, so i had fun with it.)
